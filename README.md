# STM32F4_MorseCode_Transmitter

This is a project that transmits a user string into Morse code, as the output of a (green) LED. A Morse Code is defined as a combination of dots ( . ), represented as OFF LED, and dashes ( - ), represented as ON LED. 

*Used Board: STM32F407VG Discovery Board.

v1.0:
- Reads a string pre-defined by the user.
- Only capable of alphabets (A~Z).
- Operation is terminated whenever '\0' is read, after which another LED (red) is turned on for 10seconds to indicate the end of the message transmission.

The table below shows the used Morse Code and their Hex Form (Message is transmitted from right to left):
| Character | Morse Code | Hex |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | - . | 0x10 |
| B | . . . - | 0x0001 |
| C | . - . - | 0x0101 |
| D | . . - | 0x001 |
| E | . | 0x0 |
| F | . - . . | 0x0100 |
| G | . - - | 0x011 |
| H | . . . . | 0bx0000 |
